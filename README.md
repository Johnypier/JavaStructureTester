## General Information

Automated and semi-automated tests created for use with the [Artemis](https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis) platform and the [Ares](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares) JUnit 5 extension. The purpose of structure tests is to simplify and speed up the time it takes to create exercise tests.

The tests will automatically generate and execute structure tests for the target project according to the **JSON** file containing the required project structure.
**Getters** and **Setters** tests require minimal configuration to work, see instructions in test methods.

The **JSON** structure file is usually generated by Artemis, but you can create one manually (see the example file).

### Why does this exist?

The standard structural tests supplied with Artemis templates cannot be changed/modified to suit the needs of the exercise, so in most cases the exercise creator has to write their own implementation. 
The structural tests in this repository can be easily modified with minimal effort.
